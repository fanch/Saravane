The 'which' Script 

The second option (for those who don't want to install the package) is to create a simple script (execute as the root user): 

cat > /usr/bin/which << "EOF"
#!/bin/bash
type -pa "$@" | head -n 1 ; exit ${PIPESTATUS[0]}
EOF
chmod -v 755 /usr/bin/which
chown -v root:root /usr/bin/which
