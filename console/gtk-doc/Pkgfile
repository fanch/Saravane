# Description: Contains a code documenter. This is useful for extracting specially formatted comments from the code to create API documentation. This package is optional; if it is not installed, packages will not build the documentation. This does not mean that you will not have any documentation. If GTK-Doc is not available, the install process will copy any pre-built documentation to your system.
